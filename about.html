    <h2>Message from the dev</h2>
    <p>I had always wanted to create a game. After doing an "hour of code" activity, I felt very inspired to
      continue in this unique hobby. Quickly, I found C# (for Unity) and other object-oriented languages
      too difficult to me without someone mentoring me. I decided to opt for HTML and CSS for webpage creation.
      I picked up relatively fast, even going to create the website for my high school's robotics team.
      Now, in my third year in this team, I had finally decided to work on a side project since I was
      comfortable enough making websites.
      <br>
      Originally, I began building <a href="https://hircinus.github.io/text-adventure/">
        a text adventure game</a>. I decided to jump to another idea I had, which would be this strategy text game.
        Mainly, this was because the former was not only riddled with issues from starting off the code badly,
        but it was also simply not very fun, even for me.
      <br>
      My idea revolved around what the game remains to be today: a text beat-em-up style game. Of course,
      it seems simple in theory, however there is a lot that needs to be done to even begin creating such
      a thing, at least from a beginner's perspective. This included learning about <code>onkeydown</code>
      events, the basic logic for the game and various other useful little things.

    <h1>How does this work?</h1>

    <h2>Basic idea</h2>
    <p>You are the fighter. They are the enemy. That's the objective.
      <br>
      Beat as many enemies as you can (with some strategy, of course) before losing all your health.
    <h2>Deeper look into the mechanics</h2>
    <p>During your encounters, you have four available options to choose from:
      <ol>
        <li>Sword</li>
        <li>Shield</li>
        <li>Blaster</li>
        <li>Heal</li>
      </ol>
      <em>Please bear in mind that this game is not yet fully complete, but it is functional.</em>
    </p>
      <h3>Sword</h3>
      <p>The sword ability deals 20 damage to foes and takes away 10 energy points from you.</p>
      <h3>Shield</h3>
      <p>The shield ability recovers 5 energy points for you and quarters the damage your enemy inflicts while you shield.</p>
      <h3>Blaster</h3>
      <p>The blaster ability deals 25 damage to foes and takes away 30 energy points from you. (See "Detailed game mechanics and calculations" for why this might seem wrong.)</p>
      <h3>Heal</h3>
      <p>The heal ability recovers 5 health for you but takes 10 energy. Enemies cannot hurt you while you heal.</p>
    <h2>Detailed game mechanics and calculations</h2>
      <h3>Player health</h3>
      <p>Player health is set at the beginning of the game to "100". It will decrease from enemies' attacks until it reaches zero, which is game over.
        <br>See "Enemy attack damage" for more information.
      </p>
      <h3>Player energy</h3>
      <p>Player energy, like health, is set to "100" at the beginning. It decreases with every ability the player uses (except shield, which recovers energy).
        <br>Without energy, the player cannot do any action except shield.
      </p>
      <h3>Enemy level</h3>
      <p>The foe's level ("lvl.") is determined using a random number generator that creates an integer between 1 and 10.
        <br>Many other calculations rely on this determined number, which changes after each time you defeat the previous enemy.

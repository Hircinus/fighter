    <h2>Basic idea</h2>
    <p>You are the fighter. They are the enemy. That's the objective.
      <br>
      Pick a name and beat as many enemies as you can (with some strategy, of course) before losing all your health.
    </p>
    <h2>What can you do?</h2>
    <p>During your encounters, you have four available options to choose from:
      <ol>
        <li>Sword [1]</li>
        <li>Shield [2]</li>
        <li>Blaster [3]</li>
        <li>Heal [4]</li>
      </ol>
      <em>The number in square brackets is the key you can press to activate each ability.</em>
    </p>

      <h3>Player health</h3>
      <p>Player health is set at the beginning of the game to "100". It will decrease from enemies' attacks until it reaches zero, which is game over.
        <br>After each defeated foe, you regain 40 health (to a maximum of 100).
      </p>
      <h3>Player energy</h3>
      <p>Player energy, like health, is set to "100" at the beginning. It decreases with every ability the player uses (except shield, which recovers energy).
        <br>Without energy, the player cannot do any action except shield.
        <br>After each defeated foe, you regain 20 energy (to a maximum of 100).
      </p>
      <h3>Enemy level</h3>
      <p>The foe's level ("lvl.") is determined using a random number generator that creates an integer between 1 and 10.
        <br>Many other calculations rely on this determined number, which changes after each time you defeat the previous enemy.
      </p>
      <code>var lvl = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;</code>
      <h3>Enemy attack damage</h3>
      <p>The enemy's attack damage is a range that changes based on the level of the enemy.
        <br>The other elements that affect this are the blaster and shield which half and quarter this value.
      </p>
      <code>var player_dmg = Math.floor((Math.random() * 25) + 1 + (lvl - 1));</code>
      <br>
      <code>function blaster() { ... var player_dmg = Math.floor(((Math.random() * 25) + 1 + (lvl - 1)) / 2); ... }</code>
      <br>
      <code>function shield() { ... var player_dmg = Math.floor(((Math.random() * 25) + 1 + (lvl - 1)) / 4); ... }</code>
      <h3>Enemy accuracy</h3>
      <p>The enemy's accuracy is a fixed percentage of 60%. The only exception is with the blaster ability, which decreases it to 40%.
      </p>
      <code>var ai_attack = Math.random(); if (ai_attack > 0.4) { ... }</code>
      <br>
      <code>function blaster() { ... var ai_attack = Math.random(); if (ai_attack > 0.6) { ... } ... }</code>
      <h3>Score</h3>
      <p>Your score is simply the sum of the levels of all the enemies you defeat.
